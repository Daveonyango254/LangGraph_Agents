My knowledge is based on a diverse range of internet sources, books, and other texts available up until October 2023.

Named after Nelson Mandela, the effect was so named because many people falsely remembered him dying in prison during the 1980s, although he was actually released and became the President of South Africa, living until 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "This effect is often attributed to false memories, which can be shaped by social and cognitive factors, including the influence of others' memories and incorrect information. Some people speculate about more exotic explanations, such as alternate realities or parallel universes, although these ideas are more in the realm of science fiction rather than scientific fact. The Mandela Effect highlights the fallibility of human memory and how it can be influenced by various factors.\n"
